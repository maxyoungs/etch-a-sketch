This is a project file to create a virtual etch-a-sketch or sketchpad web tool that a user can interact with.

The user is able to 'draw' on the screen by dragging their mouse over the field. Selected squares will turn light blue in color

The level of detail or pixels available for the user to draw on can be dynamically chosen by the user by pushing a "reset" button. This will also erase the previous 'drawings'
